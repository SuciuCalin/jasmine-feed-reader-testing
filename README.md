# Jasmine Feed Reader Testing

Feed Reader is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The purpose of this project is to use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application ([Feed Reader](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)). These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
